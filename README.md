# README - 300Reps

The project which helps you to accomplish 300 Reps Challange.

## About 300 Reps Challange

During one training session, you have to do 300 reps in total.
You may choose a few different exercises. For example: 

* 100x Push-ups
* 50x Pull-ups
* 50x Dips
* 100x Squats

Total: 300 

You do not need to do them in order or in fixed sets. You can do even one rep and move to another exercise. The goal is to do 300 reps. 

## ToDo

- [X] MVP
